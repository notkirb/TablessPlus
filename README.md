# TablessPlus

TablessPlus removes the player list from servers. Don't want players to see who else is online? This is the perfect plugin for you!

Allows for configuring a custom text to be shown in place of the player list, compatible with [MiniMessage](https://webui.advntr.dev/).

This plugin was made for a challenge hardcore run with my friends, alongside [notkirb/Chatless](https://github.com/notkirb/Chatless).
